# pythonexamples
Jupyter-notebooks with useful python examples for quick reference

Created this repository to put together a series of examples of python I have collected/built.

## `MultiplePlots` include:

Figures with multiple plots using:
- `plt.subplots`
- `plt.subplot2grid`
- `GridSpec`
Including:
- grids of equal size
- grids of different sizes
- grids inside `for`

Some plot adjust:

- remove tick labels
- change space between plots
- share axis

A more complex example:

- How to build a plot composed by several subplots with a major axis.
